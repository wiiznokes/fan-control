For translators:
You can translate the value used in the app in [this folder](./i18n/).
For adding a new language, copy paste the "en" folder and start translating from its files. "en" is the source of truth.
The name of the folders follow [this convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes).

Support for [pontoon](https://github.com/mozilla/pontoon) (a tool for making translation) will be added at some point.

You can also translate the [metainfo](./resource/linux/metainfo.xml) file and the [desktop entry](./resource/linux/desktop_entry.desktop).
